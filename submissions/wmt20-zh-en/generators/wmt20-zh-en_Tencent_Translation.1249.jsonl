Similar to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, which mainly serves domestic aviation affairs, Pudong Airport is dominated by international shipping aviation. In the future, Capital Airport and Daxing Airport will also serve different domestic and international aviation services and provide more subdivided services."}

It can also reduce a series of problems caused by the excessive concentration of routes, such as the longer the guarantee time for crossing the station, the slower the boarding speed of passengers, indirectly increasing the stay time of aircraft and passengers at the airport, increasing the burden of airport operation, and actually improving the travel experience of passengers through the capital airport."}

{"seg_id": "chinanews.com.102554::17", "set_id": 426, "hyp": "From this, it can be seen that the navigation of Daxing International Airport has not only added several runways and several aircraft. Whether from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, or from the level of regional aviation integration and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration, it has far-reaching and positive significance. It not only concerns the long-term layout and development of Beijing's shipping industry, provides diversified options for the travel of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei residents, promotes the further improvement of the service quality of Beijing's shipping industry, and is more conducive to promoting the integrated development process of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, driving the economic and trade development of the surrounding areas of Daxing Airport."}
