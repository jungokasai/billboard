The choice of the rail transit subway Daxing Airport Line is limited to 20 kilometers and 30 kilometers, and the ticket price is divided into 10 yuan, 25 yuan and 35 yuan.

It is not only related to the long-term layout and development of Beijing's shipping industry, it provides diversified options for the travel of the vast majority of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei residents, promotes the further improvement of the service quality of Beijing's shipping industry, and is more conducive to promoting the integrated development process of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the economic and trade development of the surrounding areas of Daxing Airport."}
