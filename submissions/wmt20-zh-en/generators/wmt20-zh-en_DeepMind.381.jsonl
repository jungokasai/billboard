The special section sets up \"land contract management right\" and \"land management right\" respectively, making a clear distinction between the transfer of land contract management right, the exchange of land contract management right and the transfer of land management right (leasing, subcontracting, equity participation or other means)."}
{"seg_id": "chinanews.com.102503::9", "set_id": 1994, "hyp": "In this Opinion Draft, in order to implement the concept of \"separation of powers\", effectively respond to the main thrust of the amendment to the Rural Land Contracting Law, and take into account that the transfer of land management rights and the exchange and transfer of land contract management rights are quite different in terms of parties, procedures and supervision, this revised draft defines the scope of transfer, focusing on the transfer of land management rights. The transfer methods include leasing and equity participation. The name of the regulations will be changed from the \"Measures for the Management of the Transfer of Rural Land Contract Management Rights\" to the \"Measures for the Management of the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights\"."}
