His psychiatrist, Dr. Santoch Rai, has said in front of the review board that \"\"if Matthew de Grood were to commit another offence, it would be severe.\"\" Despite his perceived improvement, there is still risk of re-offense.

{"seg_id": "gateway-zh.135::5", "set_id": 997, "src": "As long as de Grood continues to take his medication, there isn't a huge risk of reoffense, so why are people so concerned? I believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness, particularly those with schizophrenia, largely influences this fear. Certain mental illnesses have become less stigmatized, such as mood and anxiety disorders. But others, including schizophrenia, remain highly stigmatized. This is in large part due to numerous portrayals of schizophrenics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people."}

In fact, the majority of schizophrenic individuals are nonviolent, and are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of crime or violence.

A parole-like system where he has to check in to make sure he's still taking his medication could work well.

It perpetuates the idea that mentally ill people, those with schizophrenia in particular, cannot ever mesh with society; thus continuing the stigma and perpetuating the idea that they are dangerous criminals.
